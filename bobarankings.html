  <p style="padding-top: 0px; display: block;">Whenever I go to a new city for math travel, no matter how terrible the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea">boba</a> scene is, I make sure to research the best one I can find and rate it!</p>
  <p style="padding-top: 20px; display: block;">I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_list"> S-A-B-C-D-E-F rating system </a> (no comment on the incorrect fruit rankings in the picture). "S" means the boba was life-changing (like <a href="https://www.bobaguys.com/">Boba Guys</a> lychee rose black tea). "A" means that I would recommend to a friend and return again. "B" means I might go again, if there's no better options (depending on how hard the boba cravings hit). "C" means it was average, nothing to write home about, and probably not worth visiting. "D" means that I actively did not enjoy it. "E" means it was borderline undrinkable. "F" means it was undrinkable and I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.</p>
  <p style="padding-top: 20px; display: block;">Keep in mind that although my opinions about boba are strong and I've been drinking it since I was 5 years old so I am kind of an expert, you may feel differently. Keep in mind also that I am very cheap, so cost is definitely a factor.</p>
